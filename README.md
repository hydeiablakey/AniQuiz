## Description
The purpose for AniQuiz is to test and improve one's knowledge on anime, manga, and anime quotes. The webpage provides an option between the 3 aforementioned categories. Once a category is selected, the player will have to select from the multiple choice answers displayed. Depending on the users answer a model will appear either congratulating the player or revealing the correct answer. Using the Jikan API, we retrieve an image for the question and four possible choices for both the anime and manga categories. We apply the second API (AnimeChan) to retrieve data for the questions of the anime quotes category and its four possible answer choices.
